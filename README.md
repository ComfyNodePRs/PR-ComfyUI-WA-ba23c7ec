# ComfyUI-WA
Comfy UI Bot in WhatsApp.

![WhatsApp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1f9faa8-4704-4928-8a75-fb7ada4956ad)

It's a work in progress, and I will post it in this repository. The idea is simple: you can run your ComfyUI connected to WhatsApp, allowing you to generate images from anywhere using your own workflow(s).

Features i am working on:

- Ability to select workflow(s)
- Ability to edit nodes of workflows
- Ability to Queue/Interrupt
- Ability to Make It Multi User / Single User 

- You could star this repository for following future updates.
